# Code Genie Workspace Ignore File
# ---------------------------------
# Add files and patterns here to exclude them from the workspace summary.
# This helps the AI focus on the most relevant parts of your code.
#
# The syntax is the same as .gitignore.

# Default patterns (can be overridden in VS Code settings)
node_modules/
dist/
build/
out/
*.log
*.lock

# Add your project-specific patterns below
# For example:
#
# /temp/
# *.tmp
# /config/secrets.json
